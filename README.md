# Description
Static informational website about COVID-19 built with HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. Contains Chinese translations.

It may seem a bit silly but mind you, I had no prior web design experience and very limited prior coding knowledge. :)

Feedback is appreciated.

# Background
Summer 2020 Web Design Course at Mission Bit, ~3 or 4 weeks of instruction. 

Demo Day Project to sum up the knowledge we gained from lessons, built within 2 weeks.
